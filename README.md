## My Portfolio Website

### About
This is a simple portfolio site I built for myself from scratch. I did not use any component library or css framework besides styled components. It is fully responsive and has good browser compatibility.

Built with:

Front end: React, TypeScript, styled-components, react-scrollmagic

Back end: Node, express, nodemailer
